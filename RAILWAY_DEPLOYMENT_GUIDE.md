# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting Guide
**Date:** October 16, 2024  
**Issue:** Backend returning 502 errors despite correct Dockerfile configuration  
**Status:** Requires manual Railway dashboard intervention

---

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Backend code:** Tested locally on port 8888 - works perfectly
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8888/health
  # Returns: {"status":"healthy","service":"SwellSense API"}
  ```
- **Dockerfile:** Correctly configured with dynamic PORT
  ```dockerfile
  WORKDIR /app/backend
  CMD sh -c "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
  ```
- **Git commits:** All pushed to origin/main successfully
  - `ab49b2c`: Fix PORT variable usage
  - `e09f06e`: Clean up railway.json and clarify Dockerfile

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working
- **Railway deployment:** Still returning 502 errors
  ```bash
  curl -I https://api.swellsense.app/health
  # Returns: HTTP/2 502 Application failed to respond
  ```
- **Timeline:** 502 errors persist 90+ seconds after pushing commit e09f06e (13:28)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Railway is either:
1. **Not detecting the new commits** from GitHub
2. **Caching an old Docker image** from previous builds
3. **Stuck in a failed deployment state** requiring manual intervention
4. **Missing environment variables** that cause startup failure

---

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Check Railway Dashboard

Go to: **https://railway.app/dashboard**

1. **Select your project:** swellsense
2. **Select your service:** backend (or whatever it's named)
3. **Check Deployments tab:**
   - Is there a deployment for commit `e09f06e`?
   - If yes, what's its status? (Building/Deploying/Failed/Success)
   - If no, Railway hasn't detected the push yet

### Step 2: View Deployment Logs

If a deployment exists for `e09f06e`:
1. Click on the deployment
2. Go to **"Logs"** tab
3. Look for:
   ```
   ‚úÖ GOOD: INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:<dynamic_port>
   ‚ùå BAD:  INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
   ```
4. Check for any **ERROR** or **WARNING** messages
5. Look for the **healthcheck** results

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí **Variables**:

**Required Variables:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:...
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_KEY=...
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
SECRET_KEY=...
ALGORITHM=HS256
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Check:**
- [ ] All variables are set
- [ ] No typos in variable names
- [ ] DATABASE_URL has correct connection string
- [ ] PORT is NOT manually set (let Railway auto-assign)

### Step 4: Manual Redeploy

If deployment exists but is stuck or failed:

**Option A: Redeploy from Dashboard**
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Find commit `e09f06e`
3. Click **three dots (...)** ‚Üí **Redeploy**

**Option B: Trigger via Git**
```bash
cd /Users/ryanbradshaw/Git\ Projects/swellsense/swellsense
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Railway redeploy"
git push origin main
```

**Option C: Railway CLI** (if installed)
```bash
railway up --service backend
```

---

## Expected Results After Successful Deployment

### 1. Railway Logs Should Show:
```
Starting Container
INFO:     Started server process [X]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:main:‚è∏Ô∏è  Global ingestion scheduler disabled
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:7XXX  <-- DYNAMIC PORT
INFO:     100.64.0.2:XXXXX - "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

**Key indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Port is **dynamic** (like 7823, 7456, NOT 8080 or 8000)
- ‚úÖ Health check returns **200 OK**
- ‚úÖ No "Application failed to respond" messages

### 2. External Endpoints Should Work:
```bash
# Health check
curl -I https://api.swellsense.app/health
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 OK

# Root endpoint
curl https://api.swellsense.app/
# Expected: {"message":"Welcome to SwellSense API üåä",...}

# API info
curl https://api.swellsense.app/api/info
# Expected: {"name":"SwellSense API","version":"1.0.0",...}

# Forecast health
curl https://api.swellsense.app/api/forecast/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok" or "degraded",...}
```

## If Railway Deployment Succeeds But Still 502

This suggests a **routing or proxy issue**:

### Check Railway Service Settings

1. **Public Networking:**
   - Verify service has a **public domain** assigned
   - Check if custom domain `api.swellsense.app` is properly configured
   - Ensure DNS records point to Railway

2. **Health Check Settings:**
   ```json
   Path: /health
   Timeout: 30 seconds
   ```
   - If timeout is too short, increase to 60s
   - Try temporarily disabling healthcheck to see if service becomes accessible

3. **Port Configuration:**
   - Verify no manual PORT override in Variables
   - Railway should auto-assign PORT
   - Check if service is listening on internal port correctly

---

## Common Railway Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Deployment succeeded but 502 persists"
**Solution:** Check if healthcheck is timing out before app fully starts
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Health Check ‚Üí Increase timeout to 60s
- Or temporarily disable healthcheck

### Issue 2: "Logs show port 8080 instead of dynamic port"
**Solution:** Railway is using cached image
- Delete all deployments
- Trigger fresh deploy: `git commit --allow-empty && git push`

### Issue 3: "No deployment for latest commit"
**Solution:** GitHub webhook not working
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí GitHub
- Disconnect and reconnect repository
- Or manually trigger deployment

### Issue 4: "Build succeeds but container crashes on startup"
**Solution:** Check environment variables
- Missing DATABASE_URL or other critical vars
- Check logs for `connection refused` or `401 unauthorized` errors

---

## Next Steps After Railway Fix

Once backend is confirmed working:

### 1. Verify All Endpoints
```bash
# Run these commands to verify:
curl -I https://api.swellsense.app/health
curl https://api.swellsense.app/
curl https://api.swellsense.app/api/info
curl https://api.swellsense.app/api/forecast/health
curl "https://api.swellsense.app/api/facebook/data-deletion-status?id=test"
```

### 2. Fix Frontend API URL

**Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select `swellsense` project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add or verify:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.swellsense.app
   ```
5. Apply to: **Production**, **Preview**, **Development**
6. Redeploy frontend if needed

### 3. Test Frontend Pages
- https://swellsense.app/forecast (should load surf data)
- https://swellsense.app/account (should load user profile)

### 4. Clean Up Duplicate Files
```bash
cd /Users/ryanbradshaw/Git\ Projects/swellsense/swellsense
git rm frontend/lib/api.ts
git commit -m "chore: remove duplicate frontend/lib/api.ts"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Final Verification Commit
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: finalize Railway backend deployment stability (dynamic port verified)

‚úÖ Railway deployment successful
‚úÖ Backend responding on all endpoints
‚úÖ Frontend API connectivity verified
‚úÖ Infrastructure audit complete"
git push origin main
```

## Summary

**Current Status:** Code is correct, Railway deployment needs manual intervention

**Your Action Required:**
1. Log into Railway dashboard
2. Check deployment status for commit `e09f06e`
3. Review logs for errors
4. Manually trigger redeploy if needed
5. Verify dynamic PORT is being used (not 8080)

**Expected Timeline:** Once redeployed, backend should be online in 2-3 minutes

**Files Modified Today:**
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed to use `$PORT` directly
- `railway.json` - Removed ignored `startCommand`
