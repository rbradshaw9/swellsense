## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- PostgreSQL database (Neon or Supabase account)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rbradshaw9/swellsense.git
   cd swellsense
   ```

2. **Set up backend environment**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database URL and API keys
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # Or use: uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Set up frontend environment**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

**Important:** The current `vercel.json` configuration deploys only the **frontend** to Vercel. The backend will be deployed separately (e.g., Railway, Render, or AWS Lambda) in future versions.

1. **Deploy Frontend via GitHub Integration (Recommended)**
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically deploy the Next.js frontend
   - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard

2. **Deploy via Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

**Note:** The `vercel.json` includes backend configuration for future serverless deployment, but currently only the frontend builds successfully.

**Required Environment Variables in Vercel:**

Set these in your Vercel project dashboard:

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string (already configured)
- `SECRET_KEY` - JWT secret key for authentication (generate one below)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Your API URL (will be auto-generated)

**Generate a SECRET_KEY:**
```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
```
Copy the output and use it as your `SECRET_KEY` in Vercel.

**Optional:**
- `NOAA_API_KEY` - NOAA data access key (for future features)
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` - Weather data API key (for future features)

**Project Structure:**
- Frontend deploys from `/frontend` directory (Next.js)
- Backend currently runs separately (future: serverless functions)

### Database Setup

**Using Neon:**
1. Create account at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy connection string to `DATABASE_URL`

**Using Supabase:**
1. Create account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy connection string to `DATABASE_URL`

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, access the interactive API documentation at:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_forecast.py
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Run React Native tests
